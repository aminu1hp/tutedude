# Task 1: Calculate factorial using a Function
This program takes input from the user and calculates its factorial value.

How it works:
- The program first takes input from user.
- Converts the input to integer value and assign to variable named `num`
- Then the `function` starts
  - Function checks the value of `num` is less than 2 then it returs 1 becasue factorial value of 0 and 1 is 1
  - Then starts the `else` statement.
  - If the `num` is greater or equal to 2 then it calculates the factorial value in recursion
- Then the program put the function into variable named `result`
- Finally, it prints the value of the `result`.

### Example:
```
Enter a number: 6
Factorial of  6 is:  720
```

# Task 2: Using Math module for Calculations
This program takes input from the user and then uses the `math` module to caculate it.

How it works:
- The program takes input from the user.
- Converts the input to integer value and assign to a variable called `num`
- Then the different math calculation is assigned to different variables
- Then the different variables are printed.

### Exaple:
```
Please enter a number: 4
Square root of number is:  2.0
Logarithm:  1.3862943611198906
Sine:  -0.7568024953079282
