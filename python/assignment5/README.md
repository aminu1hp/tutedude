# Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
This program takes user input and get the marks from the dictionary else it shows error message.

How it works:
- The dictionary is mentioned first.
- Then the program takes user input and store it into variables.
- Then it uses the `.get` to get the student's mark from the dictionary and store it into `marks` variable.
- Then the program uses `if` `else` statement 
- It checks if it returns `None` then it shows Error message else it shows the marks of the student.

### Example:
```
Please enter the student's name: Raja
Raja's score is:  70

Please enter the student's name: Raj
Raj not found
```

# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
This program shows a list and slice it into first five elements and then reverse it.

How it works:
- The program contains the list from 1 to 10 in variable `list1`.
- It prints out `list1` as it is.
- Then the program slices the `list1` the first five elements and stores into variables `first_five`.
- Then it reverses the `first_five` and finally prints out the reversed `first_five`

### Example:
```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
