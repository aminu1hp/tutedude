# Task 1: Check if the number is Odd or Even
This program takes input from user and checks if the value is Even or ODD.

How it works:
- The program first takes integer input as a number from user
- Then put the integer value into variable `num_value`
- Then it uses if statement and calculates the number using modulus
- If the caculation finds without any remainder then it prints the number as Even
- Else statement shows if there's remainder then it's Odd number.

### Example:
```
Enter a number: 2
2 is an even number.
```

# Task 2: Sum of Integer from 1 to 50 using Loop
This program calculates the sum value of integer number from 1 to 50 and prints out the total.

How it works:
- The program has variable named `counter` and the value is 0
- Then the range is defined, start value 1, end value 51 and increment by 1. The value gets assigned to `i`
- Then the counter gets incremented by value of `i` in for loop

### Example:
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
