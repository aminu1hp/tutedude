# Calculator Using Tkinter
This program creates a basic calculator and calculates the result, also has a Menu just to include and show it in the program.

How it works:
- It imports everthing of `tkinter` module along with `messagebox`.
- Creates the GUI window with title and size and colors.
- Display some message with Yes/No and Error `messagebox`.
- It creates the menu and submenus which call the `messagebox` and display it.
- Different buttons are created and gets called by `click` definition and shows correct value.
- Then it defines different operators.
- Also defines the operators calculation if it matches particular button pressed.
- Finally, it shows the result in the entry box.
